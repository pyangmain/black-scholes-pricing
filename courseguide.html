                              As intro to programming courses go, this one felt wayyy too long. I feel like if I had the chance to do this class over,
                               I could learn all the content in 2-3 weeks instead of stretching it out over an entire semester. I would highly recommend 
                               self-studying and requesting an override into COMP SCI 300 or taking an accelerated course at a community college and transferring it over as credit instead of taking this class.

                              This class (despite what CS majors tell you), didn't feel that hard. You may struggle with proofs in the beginning, but after a while it isn't so bad.
                              Keep in mind that this class is cross-listed as math, with the cs department teaching in the fall and the math department teaching in the winter. If you are a cs/ce major, 
                              I would heavily recommend taking this class with the cs department in the fall, as it prepares you better for Intro. to Algorithms.

                              This class for me was a hard introduction to proofs. The class was very abstract compared to the math courses I had taken in the past, and many times I was left wondering
                              what I was even doing. That being said, this class defintely reaffirmed my decision to major in math, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the rigor in upper-level mathematics. 
                              If you are at all considering majoring in mathematics, I would defintely recommend taking this class, especially if you are already majoring in computer science, as linear algebra is 
                              incredibly important for many upper-level electives(ML, Optimization, Cryptography, etc). We mostly used <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/ar2145/notes/F21_341_lecture_notes.pdf" target="_blank">course notes</a>, but we pretty much followed Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence

                              This class serves as a way to see the theory behind Calc 1, and a good introduction to proofs. We used Spivak's Calculus as our textbook. The assignments were usually pretty tough, but the exams in comparison 
                              were easier. If you are confident in your proof skills, I would say to 
                              skip this class and take Analysis, but if you want a little more practice with proofs, this class is for sure a good choice. This class pretty much covers the second half of MATH 521: Analysis

                              This class was crazy hard. We jumped from topic to topic very frequently, and I felt that the class moved too quickly for me to fully understand topics. Homework ranged from super easy to incredibly 
                              unintuitive, exams were easier in comparison. A lot of math topics were mentioned but not deeply covered(Borel Sigma-Algebras, Lebesgue Integral, Characteristic functions). I would recommend taking MATH: 431 as your first introduction to probability
                              instead of this class. Vadim was a cool professor. He's a super knowledgable guy, and a fellow Magic: The Gathering player.

                              Despite the general sentiment on Real Analysis, I didn't think this class was that bad(granted I took MATH 421 beforehand). Baby Rudin is concise, but often times to a fault. He would often just flat out
                              omit important details in proofs. Chapters 2 and 3 were especially hard, but if you gain a good grasp of those two chapters, the rest of the book will follow nicely. Maxim was super chill and a good professor,
                              don't listen to the people who badmouth him for the one semester he taught MATH 340 during covid.

                              Compared to COMP SCI 200, this class was a lot more work. Programming assignments were pretty time consuming, but the topics covered weren't that hard to grasp. Exams and Homework were also pretty easy. 
                              I would recommend learning git/github in conjunction with this class, as it serves as a good way to archive your code, as well as learn software that you will use for the rest of your computer science career. If possible,
                              take this class with Hobbes Legault. She should be referred to as Hobbes LeGOAT. She's incredibly charismatic, her lectures are engaging and informative, and just has good vibes across the board.

                              If I had to describe this class in one word it would be tedious. This class isn't hard in the slightest, but you cover pretty dull subjects and spend your time tracing code and converting between numeral systems.
                              The silver lining is that exams are virtually identical to the homework, so just study the homework and exams won't be bad.

                              I never thought I would be taught Japanese by a Turkish person, but it turned out to be a great experience! Bozeru sensei is super enthusiastic and attentive to questions. Attendance for this class was mandatory, which was great(atleast for me), as I was able to 
                              interact a lot with my classmates. Just know that if you take this class, you either are a weeb, or will be surrounded by them. Overall a very chill class and good introduction to the Japanese language.
