# Options Price Calculator using Black-Scholes Model

This GitHub project showcases a Python program designed to calculate the theoretical price of options contracts, leveraging the renowned Black-Scholes model. With this tool, users can accurately estimate the value of options based on various parameters.

# Key Features:

Black-Scholes Options Pricing: The core functionality of this project revolves around implementing the Black-Scholes model to determine the theoretical price of options contracts. This enables users to gain insights into the potential value of their options under different market conditions.

Real-time Risk Free Rates and Historical Volatility: To enhance accuracy, the program utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping. It fetches real-time risk-free rates and historical volatility by parsing relevant HTML content from websites. This ensures that the most up-to-date and relevant data is incorporated into the calculations.

TDAmeritrade API Integration: By integrating the TDAmeritrade API, this project offers the capability to display real-time Bid/Ask prices and the last trade price data. This dynamic data integration enhances the accuracy of the options price calculations by incorporating real market values.
